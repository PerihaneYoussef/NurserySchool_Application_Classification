# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Classification of nursery school applications 

### Idea

A ranking system to evaluate every child's application in the nursery separately based on some attributes as: The social picture and health of the child's family, the financial status of his parents, whether the child is supported by one or two parents, etc.
Using a machine learning model that can predict the category of each child based on his/her features.
Choosing the best nursery for your child, where he can make use of his potentials and skills and feel accepted among his peers. That's why nurseries put such great effort in interviewing new children and set very strict criteria on evaluating and accepting them depending on the child and his parents financial and social standings and what they seek in a "day care" facility for their child.

### Data Set

The dataset used for this project is "Nursery Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three sub-problems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family.

 Further information can be found in the proposal.
### Set The Environement

The project is be built using Anaconda 3 and it doesn't require any additional libraries, but please ensure that you are using 'seaborn' 0.9.0 .
